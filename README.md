# mars_wrapper
This is a wrapper for Mars project. https://github.com/Tencent/mars

# Purpose of this project
Mars from Tencent is a very nice net transport layer solution for mobile APP. while it's a little complicated to take it into use, 
I'm trying to wrappe it for simple usage. Anyone who want to involve MARS into his project could take this one as a start or a reference.

# Windows
1. compile MARS and copy the mars.lib(marsd.lib if debug) to ./libs/mars/windows
2. cd ./build and mkdir _run
3. cd ./build/_run and cmake ..
4. open vs solution and compile/run the demo

# Android
Comming soon.
